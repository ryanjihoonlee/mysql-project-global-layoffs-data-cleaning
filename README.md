# Data Cleaning on Global Layoffs Dataset

## Overview
This project focuses on data cleaning using MySQL. The goal is to transform raw data into a more usable format by addressing issues such as duplicates, inconsistencies, and null values. 

## Objective
The primary objectives of this project are to remove duplicates, standardize data, handle null and blank values, and remove unnecessary columns and rows.

## Tools
The analysis was conducted using MySQL. Various SQL commands are employed, including Data Definition Language (DDL) commands to create and modify tables and databases, Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands to query and update data, and functions and expressions for data processing.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of global layoff data, which includes detailed information about layoffs around the world starting from 2020. It contains columns such as company, location, industry, total laid off (the number of employees laid off by a company), percentage laid off (the proportion of the company's workforce that was laid off, expressed as a percentage), date, stage (the business stage of the company, e.g., Post-IPO, Series A, Series B, Series C, etc.), country, and funds raised (millions) (the total amount of funds the company has raised, expressed in millions of dollars), providing a comprehensive view of layoffs across different regions and industries.
